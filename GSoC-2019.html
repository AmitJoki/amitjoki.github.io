        <p>It seems like only yesterday when I got the email of
          being selected for Google Summer of Code 2019.</p>
        <p>My project for Google Summer of Code 2019, with Wikimedia was to add Multi-Wiki support to <a
            href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard">WikiEduDashboard.</a></p>
        <p><strong>WikiEduDashboard</strong> is a learning tool
          based on editing the Wiki Articles. Instructors assign students, articles, and track their edits
          and grade them. In the process of editing, students learn.</p>
        <p>It’s been nearly 3 months after that mail and this page is the culmination of all that delicious coding
          period, the finer details of which we will be going through shortly. </p>
        <p>But before that if you want to try out the features I added, my changes are all live at <a
            href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org">Wiki Education Dashboard</a>. Go check it out!</p>

        <h2><a id="multi-wiki" href="#multi-wiki"></a>Multi-Wiki Support</h2>
        <p>The main agenda this Summer of '19 was to add
          multi-wiki support to WikiEduDashboard.</p>
        <p>Before, we only tracked – a <em>home</em> <code>Wiki</code> – explicitly
          anyway. A <em>home</em> <code>Wiki</code>, is a default <code>Wiki</code>, that is a part of the
          <code>Course</code>. Any edits/revisions to this
          <em>home</em> <code>Wiki</code> is
          automatically tracked.</p>
        <p>Now, a <code>Wiki</code> is an ambiguous term for many. In this
          context, a <code>Wiki</code> refers to anyone of these sites:
          <blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Wikipedia</li>
              <li>Wikibooks</li>
              <li>Wikidata</li>
              <li>Wikimedia</li>
              <li>Wikinews</li>
              <li>Wikiquote</li>
              <li>Wikisource</li>
              <li>Wikiversity</li>
              <li>Wikivoyage</li>
              <li>Wiktionary</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>Almost all of these sites are multilingual – meaning,
          they support upto 346 languages. For example, there’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">English
            Wikpedia</a> as there is a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org">French Wikipedia</a>.</p>
        <p>So the first step towards adding multi-wiki support was
          to add the ability to let users choose, explicitly, the Wikis, they want to track.</p>
        <p>The solution was to let the instructors and
          facilitators choose and restrict what Wikis they want to be tracked. This will help in reducing noise from
          other irrelevant edits which belong to Wikis that don't belong to a Course.</p>
        <p>The Pull Request — <a
            href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/2922"><code>#2922</code></a>
          added a new React Component — <code>&lt;WikiSelect&gt;</code>. It made use of the excellent <a
            href="https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select">React-Select</a> package. <code>&lt;WikiSelect&gt;</code> is a React Component
          and it is a intuitive Wiki Selector. It has both <i>single</i> &amp; <i>multi</i> mode so more than one <code>Wiki</code> could be
          tracked.</p>
        <p>Once that was covered, we had to actually put it to
          use. This led to my second Pull Request — <a
            href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/2957"><code>#2957</code></a>
        </p>
        <p>In this Pull Request, I added a join table between
          <code>Course</code> and <code>Wiki</code> and hence the name, <code>CoursesWikis</code>. Through this table we
          would
          track which <code>Course</code> has which wikis enabled, which will ofcourse be updated via the <code>&lt;WikiSelect&gt;</code>
          component from the earlier PR.</p>
        <p>With all the barebone setup complete, it was time to
          actually test whether the functionality was working as intended. It had to work without breaking existing
          tests.
          It
          was achieved via this Pull Request — <a
            href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/3020"><code>#3020</code></a>,
          which added the <code>rspec</code> tests for the new functionality.

        <h2><a id="Article_Tracking" href="#Article_Tracking"></a>Article Tracking</h2>
        <p>Nextly, continuing the trend of giving people more
          control of what they want to track, the next thing I worked on was to have it so that certain articles could
          be
          excluded from being tracked.</p>
        <p>But why? – Because before, we just included all the
          articles that had been edited by the user and tracked those edits. But oftentimes, a user may have edited an
          article
          that was outside the purview of what the Course was intended for.</p>
        <p>So basically we were tracking edits which were
          potentially useless and adds on to the noise.</p>
        <p>We needed a feature wherein the
          instructor/facilitator can exclude certain articles from being tracked. I made use of the excellent <a
            href="https://github.com/markusenglund/react-switch">React-Switch</a> package to add a toggle which
          indicates
          the
          tracked status of an article.</p>
        <p>The Pull Request — <a
            href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/3102"><code>#3102</code></a>
          set
          up the the foundation to build on.</p>
        <p>This included creating a join table between
          <code>Article</code> and <code>Course</code>, named aptly, <code>ArticlesCourses</code>. This join table holds
          all the information concerning to the tracked status of all articles belonging to a <code>Course</code>.</p>
        <p>As can be seen from the comments on the PR, it was a
          major overhaul of how things worked internally in WikiEduDashboard. So it was a major refactor and a breaking
          change
          so lot of time was spent on getting this right and making sure all the existing tests passed.</p>
        <p>Once it was done, it was time to put the UI to work
          using the backend setup from the previous pull request. Pull Request — <a
            href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/3175"><code>#3175</code></a>
          is
          where I’ve used React Switch package for the neat UI for changing the tracked status of an article.</p>
        <p>Next, these two Pull Requests — <a
            href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/3195"><code>#3195</code></a>
          &amp; <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/3204"><code>#3204</code></a>
          added a way to filter the articles based on the following tracked status values:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Tracked</li>
          <li>Untracked</li>
          <li>Both Tracked and Untracked</li>
        </ol>

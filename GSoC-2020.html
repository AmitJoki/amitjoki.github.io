        <p>I was part of Google Summer of Code 2019 with
          Wikimedia and I was overjoyed when I came to know that I was going to work with the amazing folks (read: the
          best mentor anyone could get: Sage Ross) at WikiEduDashboard once again as part of Google Summer of Code 2020.
        </p>
        <p>In 2019, my project was something discrete. I could point you to the parts I worked on which weren&rsquo;t
          there before and I could go, &ldquo;Hey, see this feature? I worked on it!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>But it was going to be different this time around, for my project was abstract, something that could only be
          felt. My proposal was to improve the loading speed of WikiEduDashboard.</p>
        <p>The User Experience for people with low-bandwidth internet was not upto the mark. There were lots of
          resources needlessly being downloaded which was making the website seem slow.</p>
        <h2><a id="problems" href="#problems"></a>Problem</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Redundant resources were being downloaded.</li>
            <li>Some of the NPM packages had bloated sizes.</li>
            <li>Some heavy resources (TinyMCE) which an average user did not make use of, was still downloaded
              nonetheless.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h2><a id="solutions" href="#solutions"></a>Solution</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Extracting the common resources into a separate file and make all others refer it rather than have their
              own copy.</li>
            <li>Migrating to newer, leaner NPM packages, thereby significantly reducing the bundle size.</li>
            <li>Downloading certain resources only when they are needed and not all the time.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h2><a id="implementation" href="#implementation"></a>Implementation</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>First we needed a way to measure the bundle size. For this a Webpack Bundle Analyzer was built into WikiEduDashboard via
              <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/3879">#3879</a>
            </li>
            <li>We had lots of varied tooling in the build process. We decided to have everything in Webpack. That was achieved via
              <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4038">#4038</a>
            </li>
            <li>Having put all build process within Webpack, it was a bit slow for developing. Hence Parallel Webpack was added in
              <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4054">#4054</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>lodash</code> was migrated to <code>lodash-es</code> in <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4059">#4059</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Upgraded to the latest, leaner <code>@sentry/browser</code> package in <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4064">#4064</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Shared code was optimised in <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4079">#4079</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Unused locale files and methods were removed from Moment in <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4083">#4083</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript code that was supposed to be loaded on <code>DOMContentReady</code> but that which wasn't, was loaded correctly in <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4088">#4088</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              TinyMCE was dynamically loaded only when needed in <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4101">#4101</a>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h2><a id="jscover" href="#jscover"></a>JavaScript Coverage</h2>
        <br />
        <p>Another part of the work I did was to generate coverage report for the JavaScript. Coverage reports are
          extremely useful as they let you know how much of your code is covered by the tests and where the places that
          have missed out on, are.</p>
        <p>Generally, the higher the coverage, more robust an application becomes. But there weren&rsquo;t
          well-documented ways of getting this coverage data. After much searching and experimenting, I used JSCover, a
          Java tool to instrument the code and generate the coverage reports.</p>
        <p>The initial version of the coverage did not prove to be too useful as it was done on a huge concatenated
          file. I tinkered around with the Webpack outputted files and managed to breakdown the modules into their own
          files.</p>
        <p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/jscover.png"
              alt="JSCover report for admin_role_spec.rb" data-action="zoom">
            <figcaption><em>JSCover report for admin_role_spec.rb</em></figcaption>
          </figure>
          The result is that we now have an extensive coverage report for each and every individual file which is
          great!
        </p>
        <p>
          The JSCover integration was done via <a href="https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/pull/4131">#4131</a>
